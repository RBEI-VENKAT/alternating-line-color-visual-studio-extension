#Alternating Line Color Visual Studio Extension
 
I built this from the sample shown in  [10-4 Episode 5: Code Focused in Visual Studio 2010](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/10-4-Episode-5-Code-Focused-in-Visual-Studio-2010/) 
by [Drew Robbins](http://channel9.msdn.com/Niners/drewby), 
he covers this bit about 13 minutes into his video. simply put it gives you alternating light 
and dark lines for code like back in the good old days when your code came back from processing 
in the mainframe or mini computer on piano ruled green listing paper.

The extension is available from [Visual Studio Gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/) and you can get it [here](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/5e0c81c8-4e71-450f-82aa-c9e8731b80f0)
